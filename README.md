# chatbot-cutie

For this project, you will be implementing a chatbot!

## Day 1: Templating 
1. Look up chatbot templates and create your own template for how you would like your chatbot interface!
  - Your interface must have a profile photo for the bot *and* for the user
  - Must have a container that has the entire interface and demonstrates a conversation between the bot and the user
  - Must have a footer that contains the creator of the bot
  - Must have a header that contains the title of the bot
  - Must have a section that has a description of the bot
2. Ask the teacher for approval on this template

## Day 2: HTML + CSS
1. Start creating the mockup for the page using only HTML and CSS. Ensure the mockup is exactly like the template.
2. Add a navigation bar that will redirect to different sections of the page
3. Add styles until teacher approval

## Day 3: JavaScript
1. Ensure that there is a text input field that takes in user input
2. After taking in the user input, check the string if it satisfies a certain condition for a predetermined response
3. If it satisfies a predetermined response, give a response back to the user
4. If not, write back another message that says the bot could not understand the user input
